Notes...

if u want to know the information about a command inside the termnal => use => (man) before the command 
  Ex:
   man ls => it brings info about ls command
   man sudo => it brings info about sudo command
Also exist in the most of the command the parameter -h --help that helps

Comand (sudo) it allow a user to use and execute programs as a root user emulator, 
  this way the current user can navigate, install things and modify directories without broke nothing.

apt - advance package tool - is a package manager by default on Debian

snap - is also a package manager as default on Debian

ls -s to see detailed information about a directories and content files 

//TYPES OF PERMISSIONS 
r - red
w - write 
x - execute

chmod - change mod - usage => change the permisson assingned to certain group on the users

Ex: [-rx] [-rx] [-rx] = this structure define the groups in the operative system 
    WHERE
     first position is - user => current user 
     second position is - group 
     thirf position is - others => this refers to all other user 

Also is possible to add more of one permisson at a time using coma's like this: chmod u+x,g-r,o-e 
 On this line we are saying that: 
    USER CAN EXECUTE, GROUP WILL NOT LONGER READ AND THE OTHER USER WILL BE NOT ABLE TO EXECUTE

Links
 (ln) - command link = receive as parameters the ./route and a name for the link
  Ex: ln ./Folder/this-file.txt new-file.txt 

 -hard link => a hard link is basically a link where the user will be able to edit the file begin in other directory
 
 -soft link => it creates with -s (symbolic) parameters  
 
 /Differences/ = the hard link target the content of the file
                  and the soft link target the file as a route - this means that if the user delete the first file 
                    it we not be able to continue using correctly the link.
